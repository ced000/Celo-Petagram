Hello Celo!
![Screenshot (34)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48166371/128304350-7fdb0772-233d-4c52-9ac4-6eea94c5951f.png)

Petagram is an Instagram for pets built on the Celo blockchain. It is built with HTML, CSS, JS and Solidity. It features a slider of the different pets uploaded by different users. The like or thumbs up button allows a user to both like and tip a post. This dislike button only allows a user to 'dislike', no transaction is attached to it for now - a suiting game theory is yet to be found for that. For both cases, multiple impressions are disallowed. The share button is "coming soon", you can click on it to see the "Coming soon notification".

The author of the post, has its social handle and its address placed side by side, just in case you'd like to check any of it out. 

Will there be any improvements to this project? 
A big yes! This is one of my first projects as a web/blockchain dapp developer. You can say that is a Junior Junior level project. As more skills are gained, they will be used to improve the dapp. 

***
Some improvements noted already. 
1. The posts need to be made mobile friendly. Some edge cuts off on smaller mobile devices.
2. Adding blockies to the current user so one can easily differentiate between the post author and the user of the current address being used to interact with the dapp.
3. Pagination. 
4. Categories and search. 

Bugs noticed - The Github published page, messes up my author blockies.
